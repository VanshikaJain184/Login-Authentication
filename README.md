# Login-Authentication
“This project aim is to create a webpage on login authentication.”

Here we are going to discuss and define various elements and components used to make the Login Authentication Page. I am going to elaborate entire design in three parts as follows :
 
Three components:

1.Web page Formation
2.Styling
3.Regulating Login and Register Functions

Home Page :

In this section, we have the HTML code which is actually used to form and provide structure to the web page. 
I made a heading at top of web page by using the marquee tag. I made an image slider at the left and Login and Register at the right side. 
A heading is also added on the top of the image slider. Above Login Register div there is an image containing div is also placed. I also added container dots div placed at the center of image slider.
